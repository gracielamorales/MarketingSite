# Code Refactor Starter Code
# HTML CSS Code Refactor 
For this project, I was given an HTML code which I needed to refactor (or clean-up a bit) following a marketing agency's citeria:

## Step 1
The way I decided to tackle this challenge, and how I started it, was by first looking at the website and making sure, if there were any links, that they worked and they took you where they were supposed to take you once clicked. 

Next, I looked at both the CSS and the HTML files, and looked for repetition in the styles section, and for codes that could be grouped under the same class/ID. 

These were a couple of the CSS style codes that I found to be repetitive and started doing some brainstorm about how I could group them together:

## Step 2
In order to be able to put CSS styles together, I had to look into the HTML file to see which codes corresponded to the CSS style codes. Once I figured out and matched them, I went back to HTML files and re-wrote some id's and class names to be able to group them together in one. 

```bash 
Turning this:

```bash
into this:

I went on like this until I grouped every code and every style as much as I could. While doing this, I was making sure that my regrouping or renaming of the id's and classes in the HTML document didn't change the way the website looked at the beginning. 

## Step 3
Making sure that the website at the end of this project looked the same as it did when I first started working on the files. 

I am open to comments and suggestions regarding my work with these files, including README.md.
